GCRFs library
=====================
Java library for Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRF) supports training and testing of GCRF methods on random generated datasets and real datasets.

Library supports two GCRF methods:
- Standard GCRF (GCRF) - structured regression model that incorporates the outputs of unstructured predictors (based on the given attributes values) and the correlation between output variables in order to achieve a higher prediction accuracy
- Directed GCRF (DirGCRF) -  method extends the GCRF method by considering asymmetric similarity

Use
=====================

Download jar file <a href="https://github.com/vujicictijana/Library/blob/master/gcrfs.jar?raw=true">gcrfs.jar</a> and add it to project build path.

Add following jars to project build path:
- <a href="central.maven.org/maven2/org/ujmp/ujmp-core/0.3.0/ujmp-core-0.3.0.jar">ujmp-core-0.3.0.jar</a>
