GCRFs Library
=====================
Java library for Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRF) supports training and testing of GCRF methods on random generated datasets and real datasets.

Library supports two GCRF methods:
- Standard GCRF (GCRF) - structured regression model that incorporates the outputs of unstructured predictors (based on the given attributes values) and the correlation between output variables in order to achieve a higher prediction accuracy
- Directed GCRF (DirGCRF) -  method extends the GCRF method by considering asymmetric similarity

Use
=====================

Download jar file <a href="https://github.com/vujicictijana/Library/blob/master/gcrfs.jar?raw=true">gcrfs.jar</a> and provide a reference to GCRFs Library jar file in your project.

Also, provide references to following jars:
- ojalgo-40.0.0.jar
- ojalgo-biz-40.0.0.jar
- ojalgo-ext-40.0.0.jar
- ujmp-core-0.3.0.jar

In Eclipse: right click on the project, then Build Path > Configure Build Path > Add JARs or Add External JARs, and choose jars
In NetBeans: right click on the project, then Properties > Libraries > Add JAR/Folder, and choose jars
